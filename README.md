# Life Expectancy Analysis

In this project I analyze a dataset on life expectancy for males and females of different income groups.

Here is a link to the dataset: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/life-expectancy) 

Libraries Used
   *  Python
   *  pandas
   *  matplotlib
   *  numpy

# Summary Analysis

While exploring this dataset, several notable patterns and trends emerged. 

1. **Income Group and Life Expectancy**
    * There exists a correlation between income groups and life expectancy
    * Individuals in higher income groups exibit a higher life expectancy compared to those in lower income groups
    * The highest life expectancy is observed in the high-income group, while the lowest is found in the low-income group.
    
2. **Gender Disparities**
    * Females consistently outlive males by an average of 4-5 years each year from 2000 to 2019.
    * This gender gap is greatest in the high-income group and smallest in the low-income group.
    
3. **Trends**
    * Over time the gender gap in life expectancy has shown a decreasing trend, particularly after 2010. This suggests that the gap is narrowing even though females continue to have a longer life expectancy.
    
# Inferences

Based on the observed trends, there are several inferences that can me made.

1. **Continued Gender Gap Reduction**
    * It seems that the gender gap in life expectancy will continue to decrease as time goes on.
   
2. **Gender Disparity**
    * Despite improvements, females are expected to maintain a higher life expectancy than males in all income groups

3. **Low-Income Groups**
    * In the near future, it is likely than low-income females will surpass the life expectancy of malesin the low-middle income group.
